# My Code Thoughts In Plain English

The goal of this repo is to become a better developer.

## The Strategy

* Dig up old and recent projects, and then fiddle with them at every chance I get.
* Work on a project with my new mentor and a few other developers.
* Connect with other developers through networking and blogging.
